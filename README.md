## About Me
I am a graduate student passionate about **Machine Learning**, **AI**, and intellectually stimulating problems. I am completing an MSc in **Computational Statistics and Machine Learning** at *University College London*, after an MEng in **Electrical & Electronic Engineering**, also at *University College London*.  

My background includes research scientist internships in start-ups and scale-ups, with a strong focus on applying theoretical foundations to provide hands-on solutions. I am particularly motivated by the fields of **safety**, **reasoning reliability**, and **alignment** of Large Language Models. My main goal is to have an impact on people's lives.

## Experience


### Holistic AI  
**Part-time Research Scientist**  
*London, United Kingdom â€” March 2025 â€“ Sept. 2025*  

- Contributing to two research projects expected to be published, alongside a separate academic paper based on MSc thesis.  
- Developed reproducible experimental pipelines, data preprocessing workflows, and statistical evaluation scripts in Python to ensure robustness and replicability of results. Collaborated with cross-disciplinary teams, translating technical findings into business-relevant recommendations on ethical AI deployment.    

### Qolaig  
**AI Research Scientist**  
*Paris, France â€” Jan. 2024 â€“ July 2024*  

- Focused on leveraging LLMs to deliver high-performing solutions, optimized token usage and costs to meet specific client requirements. Developed automation solutions across multiple verticals, including customer support, operations and sales.
- Modelled research on Machine Learning Operations solutions and programmed a deployment framework for Mistral 7B model, leveraged platforms such as Paper-Space to deploy dockerized models onto remote GPUs for accelerated use.

<!-- ## Fun Facts
---
- I always feel bad for not taking some modules, because there are too many choices at univerisity. So I ask my friends to send me all the lecture slides and courseworks materials, and do them on my own in my additional time.
