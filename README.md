## About me
---
I am a graduate student passionate about **Machine Learning**, **AI**, and intellectually stimulating problems. 
I am completing a MSc in **Computational Statistics and Machine Learning** at *University College London*, after an MEng in **Electrical & Electronic Engineering** also at *University College London*. 

My background includes research scientist internships in start-ups and scale ups, with a strong focus on applying theoretical foundations to provide hands-on solutions. I am particularly motivated by the fields of **safety**, **reasoning reliability** and **alignment** of Large Language Models, but my main goal is to have an impact on people's live.

<!-- ## Fun Facts
---
- I always feel bad for not taking some modules, because there are too many choices at univerisity. So I ask my friends to send me all the lecture slides and courseworks materials, and do them on my own in my additional time.
