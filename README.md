## About me
---
I am a French researcher-in-training passionate about **Machine Learning**, **AI**, and intellectually stimulating problems. 
I am completing a MSc in **Computational Statistics and Machine Learning** at *University College London*, after an MEng in **Electrical & Electronic Engineering** also at *University College London*. 

My background includes research scientist internships in start-ups and scale ups, with a strong focus on applying theoretical foundations to provide hands-on solutions. I am particularly motivated by the fields of **safety**, **reasoning reliability** and **alignment** of Large Language Models.


## Featured Projects

### [Benchmarking Normative Reasoning in LLMs](https://github.com/raphaelyana/normative_reasoning_and_stereotypes)

### [Speaker Extraction](https://github.com/raphaelyana/speaker_extraction)



## Areas of Expertise
---
- **Natural Language Processing**: Python (NLTK, SpaCy), downstream frameworks on LLMs, transformers, LSTMs.
- **Deep Learning**: Python (PyTorch), representation learning, neural network optimisation
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Dimensionality reduction, generative models
- **Probabilistic Modelling**: Bayesian methods, latent variable models
- **Optimisation**: unconstrained methods, constrained methods, non-smooth methods, all applied for convex and non-convex data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Markov decision processes, dynamic programming, policy/value-based methods

## Fun Facts
---
- I always feel bad for not taking some modules, because there are too many choices at univerisity. So I ask my friends to send me all the lecture slides and courseworks materials, and do them on my own in my additional time.
